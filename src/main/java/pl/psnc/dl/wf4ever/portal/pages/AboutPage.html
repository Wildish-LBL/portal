				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					The digital library system realizes the backbone services of a
					software architecture for the preservation of workflow-centric
					research objects. The implementation extends dLibra digital library
					framework with the notion of research objects and incorporates a
					triplestore backed by Jena TDB and a long-term preservation
					component built on dArceo system. The main interface to the digital
					library system is the set of REST APIs it implements, although it
					also provides a SPARQL endpoint. Users interact with the system via
					client applications, such as this web portal, which was developed
					alongside the digital library system. See <a

					for additional information.
