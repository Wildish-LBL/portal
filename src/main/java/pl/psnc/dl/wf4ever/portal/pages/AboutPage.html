				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					The Research Object Digital Library (RODL) system realizes the backbone services of 
					a software architecture for the preservation of workflow-centric research objects. 
					The implementation extends dLibra digital library framework with the notion of research 
					objects and incorporates a triplestore backed by Jena TDB and a long-term preservation component built on dArceo system. 
					The main interface to the digital library system is the set of REST APIs it implements, although it also provides a SPARQL endpoint. 
					Users interact with the system via client applications, such as this web portal, which was developed 
					alongside the digital library system. See 
					<a href="http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wf4ever-for-developers">http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wf4ever-for-developers</a> for additional information.
				</p>
				<p>
					RODL is one of the three main tools of wf4ever portfolio of tools, as illustrated in the figure below. 
					Each of these tools are aimed towards different types of target users and their 
					needs and represent different levels of deployment of Research Object management capabilities.

				<p>
					In particular, RODL acts as a full-fledged backend not only for scientists but also for librarians and
					potentially other communities interested in the aggregation of heterogeneous information sources with the rigor of digital libraries’ 
					best practices. RODL provides a holistic approach to the preservation of aggregated information sources and incorporates capabilities 
					to deal with collaboration, versioning, evolution and quality management of Research Objects.
